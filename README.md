It serves as a key piece of my portfolio, demonstrating my skills in building robust, performant, and user-friendly web applications with Next.js.

### Key Features:

* Static Site Generation (SSG) for fast initial page loads and improved SEO.
* Responsive design ensuring optimal viewing across all devices.
* Optimized image loading with `next/image` for performance.

### Technologies Used:

* **Next.js:** A React framework for production.
* **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Why Next.js?

I chose Next.js for this project due to its powerful capabilities that significantly enhance web application development:

* **Hybrid Rendering:** Seamlessly supports Static Site Generation (SSG), Server-Side Rendering (SSR), and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), allowing for highly optimized performance and SEO.
* **File-System Routing:** Intuitive and easy-to-manage routing based on the file structure.
* **API Routes:** Enables the creation of backend API endpoints directly within the Next.js application.
* **Image Optimization:** Built-in `next/image` component for automatic image optimization.
* **Code Splitting & Bundling:** Automatic optimization for faster loading times.
* **Developer Experience:** Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and a rich ecosystem for a smooth development workflow.
